ruby_prolog
====

An object-oriented pure Ruby implementation of a Prolog-like DSL for easy AI and logical programming. It should work under all popular Ruby interpreters. Please report compatibility problems.

The core engine is largely based on tiny_prolog, though numerous additional enhancements have been made
such as object-oriented refactorings and integration of ideas from the interwebs. Unfortunately I cannot
read Japanese and cannot give proper attribution to the original tiny_prolog author. (If *you* can, let
me know and I'll update this document!)


Usage
----

Two runnable examples are included in the 'bin' directory. The first..

    ruby-prolog-hanoi

..is a ruby-prolog solution to the well-known "Towers of Hanoi" problem in computer science. The second..

    ruby-prolog-acls

..shows the ruby-prolog DSL can be trivially used to implement an access control system. If you have some other useful or clever examples, please contribute them!


Features
----

* Pure Ruby.
* Tested with Ruby 2.0.0! 
* Object-oriented.
* Multiple Prolog environments can be created and manipulated simultaneously.
* Concurrent access to different core instances should be safe.
* Concurrent access to a single core instance might probably explode in odd ways.


Installation
----

    gem install ruby_prolog

See ruby_prolog_spec.rb for usage examples.
